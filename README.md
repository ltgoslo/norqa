# NorQA

NorQA is a collection of multiple-choice and open-ended question answering (QA) datasets for Norwegian BokmÃ¥l and Nynorsk: NorOpenBookQA, NorCommonSenseQA, NorTruthfulQA, and NRK-Quiz-QA. The datasets are designed to evaluate the LMâ€™s Norwegian-specific & world knowledge, common sense reasoning abilities, and truthfulness. The 10.5k question-answer pairs are created by a team of native Norwegian speakers through manual translation and localization of the corresponding English-oriented datasets, with a dedicated effort to also create novel Norwegian-specific examples from scratch.

## ðŸ¤— HuggingFace

Our datasets are available via the HuggingFace datasets:

- [NRK-Quiz-QA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ltg/nrk_quiz_qa)
- [NorOpenBookQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ltg/noropenbookqa)
- [NorCommonSenseQA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ltg/norcommonsenseqa)
- [NorTruthfulQA (Multiple Choice)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ltg/nortruthfulqa_mc)
- [NorTruthfulQA (Generation)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ltg/nortruthfulqa_gen)

## ðŸ¤– Evaluation

We utilize the [```NorEval```](https://github.com/ltgoslo/noreval/) framework for evaluating Norwegian generative language models. All our datasets are integrated into ```NorEval```, along with a pool of 50 prompts in both BokmÃ¥l and Nynorsk designed to represent diverse user requests and answer formats. Please refer to the framework documentation on how to evaluate a model on our datasets.

## ðŸ‘¥ Annotation guidelines

We publicly release our [annotation guidelines](./guidelines/) that are used to create the datasets. The guidelines are tailored to each dataset.
